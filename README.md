# Prototalk

This is just a prototype that I use to create my talks

## How to use it

Just edit the file at `src/config.yml` with your info and add the slides to `src/slides.yml`

## It uses 

* reveal.js
* fb-flo
* jade
* yamljs

--- 

I just made it as flexible as I needed (within the time that I had),
but feel free to fork and adjust if you think it might help you
